Somethings that I plan to do, in no particular order
=====================================================

- ~~Add Next and Prev Keys~~
- ~~Add options for other networks~~
- Open default network if none is open (Thanks @NetRoy)
- Start the command by default on mac using launchd (preferably)
- When plugin disconnects to the ws server, add a way to try to reconnect
